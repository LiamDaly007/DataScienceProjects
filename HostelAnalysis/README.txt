# Regression Analysis on Hostel Prices in Japan

## Description
My main goal is to create a linear regression model which may be used to make inferences on statistically significant predictors with prices as the response variable. 

 I'll be using the dataset “Hostel.csv." This was created by Koki Ando, who scraped data from HostelWorld.com: “a global database with over 16,000 hostels.” According to Ando, the data was scraped before the 2020 Tokyo Olympic games. 

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koki25ando/hostel-world-dataset/data.
